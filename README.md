# C++ Projects â€“ Ryan Marcum

Welcome to my collection of C++ projects created during my Computer Engineering degree and personal practice. These projects demonstrate my growing experience with object-oriented programming, algorithm implementation, and system-level programming using C++.

## ðŸ”§ Projects Included

### 1. **Data Structures & Algorithms**
- **Examples**: Linked lists, stacks, queues, binary trees, sorting algorithms, and recursion.
- **Skills Used**: Object-oriented design, dynamic memory management, modularization

### 2. **File I/O & Text Processing**
- **Project**: Command-line app to parse, search, and manipulate text files.
- **Skills Used**: C++ file handling, string manipulation, CLI interaction

### 3. **Grade Book System**
- **Summary**: A console-based grade book application that tracks student records, assignments, and averages.
- **Skills Used**: Classes, arrays/vectors, file input/output, conditionals and loops
- **Features**: Add/remove students, input grades, calculate averages, save/load to file

### 4. **Other Practice Programs**
- **Topics Covered**: Pointers, inheritance, exception handling, STL usage, etc.

## ðŸ“š What I Learned

- Writing clean, modular, and maintainable C++ code
- Debugging with tools like GDB and Visual Studio Code
- Using version control (Git) to track and manage development
- Applying core computer science concepts through code

## ðŸ§° Tools & Languages

- **Language**: C++
- **IDE**: Visual Studio Code, Code::Blocks
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub
- **OS**: Windows & Linux

## ðŸ“Ž Notes

Each project folder contains source code files (`.cpp`, `.h`) and may include a `README.md` specific to that project for more details.
